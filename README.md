# College Notes - Android Application

This project was developed to fill a personal need for an app that combined note taking functionality with the ability to see/edit/add events to the calendar, with extra functionality to input class information and have class times and exams also be added to the calendar. Essentially, this app provides CRUD functionality for notes, classes, and calendar events to manage everything a college student might need, all within a single application instead of separate ones.

Not only was this a project done for practical purposes, it was also done so that I could learn about Android application development along the way. Here's some of the stuff that I learned during development:
* Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* Hilt-Dagger
* Android Room
* Software architecture styles (this project uses clean architecture)
* Software architecture design patterns (this project uses MVVM)
